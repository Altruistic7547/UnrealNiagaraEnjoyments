# UnrealNiagaraEnjoyments

**Unreal Niagara Enjoyments** is a personal project aimed at exploring and enjoying the **Niagara system** in **Unreal Engine** for creating advanced visual effects. 

This project showcases **custom visual effects**, from simple particle emitters to complex systems, dominating power of the **Niagara VFX system**. 

The intention was on understanding Niagara's capabilities and applying them creatively in real-time environments.

## Why This Project?
- To gain hands-on experience with the **Niagara visual effects** system in Unreal Engine.
- To create visually compelling and performant VFX for real-time applications.
- To explore advanced techniques in **particle simulations**, **dynamic materials**, and **custom script integration**.
- To create engaging and interactive visual effects for various applications, including games, simulations, and architectural visual


## Key Features
- **Particle Emitters**: Custom particle emitters configured for different scenarios such as smoke, fire, and spark effects.
- **Dynamic Materials**: Integrated dynamic material instances to enhance visual fidelity.
- **Advanced Particle Behaviors**: Implemented complex behaviors like trails, collisions, and real-time interaction with game elements.
- **Scripted Effects**: Used Niagara **script modules** to add customized behaviors and effects.
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques for ensuring high performance and efficiency, including LOD (Level of Detail) settings and GPU-based particle systems.

## Tools and Technologies i enjoyed in this project
- **Unreal Engine (UE 4.26, UE 5)**: Primary game engine used for development.
- **Niagara System**: Advanced VFX system for creating real-time visual effects.
- **Blueprint Scripting**: For connecting and triggering Niagara effects within gameplay.
- **Material Editor**: Used to create shaders and materials that complement the VFX.
- **Blender/Maya**: Used for creating and importing base meshes if needed.

## Project file structure

I have made sure to follow official unreal engine documentation and found out the best practices. One of the best practice is to create seamless reusable and developer friendly file structure.

## How do you really enjoy this project? 

1. **Download the Project Files**: Clone the project files from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pitPwyUM1bznsUzCCL5sVA_Q-AzhWxtg?usp=sharing).
2. **Open in Unreal Engine**: Open the project in **Unreal Engine** (version 5.x recommended).
3. **Explore Niagara Assets**: Navigate to the Niagara_Enjoyments_01 and open up any Niagara folder which contains all Niagara system and module. 
4. **Build All Levels**: Go to Build -> Build All Levels. Alternatively, if you do not have optimal system, you can open any specific map and just build reflection captures.
5. Enjoy!
